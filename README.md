- 👋 Hi, I’m @woh1wend
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, but mostly I aim to develop some tools that I would like to use in my own website. How? I'm not sure. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, html, css and javascript, eventually I'll look into ruby. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I'm not sure, because I still struggle with the concept of github.
- 📫 To reach me, just send a message, I think? Everyrhing's public here at "home", so feel free to check stuff and perhaps do some constructive criticism. Thanks!
